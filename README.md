Reflections on building this app:

This was by far one of the hardest applications I've built so far, and it's not 100% functional yet. I struggled with really
understanding anything about React, and while I feel I had a decent understanding of Express, when React was tossed into the mix, it
completely blew my mind and I honestly felt completely lost throughout this entire process. This build is actually part 2 of this
application. I cloned my repo and built off the bones I had. In doing that, I was able to to make my app more reactive. I was having issues with having to refresh my application, every time I was being directed to another page. So, that was a plus.

I was was able to rebuild this in a much better way, and was able to work through some of my issues. When I started off, I had all my components together, when I did the 2nd build, I created folders for each component for the specific items I was working with, which made this a lot more organized.

I struggled with my user stories, as I really didn't have a wonderful understanding of the flow of how things work. During this
project, I did get a little better understanding, but I would love  to rebuild this and get the process down and really understand what I am doing. It was really hard. I also struggled with my git pushes, as every time I touched something, it broke.

I did learn a lot about debugging, and I am very aware of my weaknesses when reaching out for help, when needed. I am very big on trying to figure it out, because that is how I learn, but when I have a deadline to meet, I know I need to be better about it. Much better about it. Everything we do, we have the ability to learn from. I am not pleased with my progress on this project at all, but I am proud of myself for not giving up. I don't think I had more than 5 hours of sleep one night while working on this.

I had created a timeline for myself on this and I was hoping to get to the 3rd party API by Wednesday, and have styling time on Thursday and Friday, needless to say, that didn't happen.

I need to get better about using my user stories with trello. I am much better at staying on track when I have them in front of my face, when they are touchable (SCRUM), and I am aware I need to get better with that.

Goals:

I would really like to get my full CRUD working as soon as possible, I am currently still debugging the POST call, which is the key for the UPDATE and DELETE. I would also love to get in a 3rd party API to generate the movies for me(IMDB). I would also like to add my ratings and a like/dislike button. I really would love to get more comfortable with React overall. I would love to get more styling in on this app as well.
